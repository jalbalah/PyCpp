PyCpp converts template code that is modeled 
after python syntax into C++ code by mapping directly.

Quick Start

lessons:

hello world:  
`./lessons/lesson1`

classes:  
`./lessons/lesson2`

class members:  
`./lessons/lesson3`

static class members:  
`./lessons/lesson4`

lists and loops:  
`./lessons/lesson5`

strings and vectors:
`./lessons/lesson6`

reading and writing files:  
`./lessons/lesson7`

To speed up developement, see in `build.py`:
```bash
# comment out to skip compiling lessons
transpile_and_compile('lessons')
```
