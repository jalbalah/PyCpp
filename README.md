Quick Start

See test.py, from which test.cpp was 
transpiled. There are examples of how
to implement object oriented algorithms
in pythonic code that map directly to C++. 


The goal of PyCpp is to write code with 
minimally-capable syntax and language nuance.
One should, in simplest and most intuitive
prototyping, write classes to represent objects
and loops to implement algorithms. Assignments
instantiation, all will be implemented 
according to a limited set of idioms.

In return for following these idioms, it is
possible to quickly code in a language that
is nearly the same as python, but directly
maps to a readable, simple and low-level
C++ generated implementation.

In practice, developers experiment with
sample files that demonstrate syntax. 
Staying within the domain of existing 
examples will ensure that the code is
generated correctly -- able to compile
after transpiling to C++
